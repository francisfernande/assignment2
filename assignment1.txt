A1. In the below elements which of them are values or an expression? eg:- values can be integer or string and expressions will be mathematical operators.

    * --> expression 
    'hello' --> value
    -87.8 --> value
    - --> expression
    / --> expression
    + --> expression
    6 --> value



2. What is the difference between string and variable?

A2.  A string is sequence of characters which are enclosed in "" or '' or it    can be a specific type of data but variable is a symbolic name you can assign a value in python +  variables can hold various types of data.
 



3. Describe three different data types.

A3. (a.) --> integr: This data type represents whole numbers, both positive and negative, without any decimal point.
    (b.) --> float: This data type represents numbers with decimal points.
    (c.) --> string: This data type represents text or a sequence of characters.



4. What is an expression made up of? What do all expressions do?

A4. A combination of operands and operators are called expression. It produces some value or result after being interpreted.



5. This assignment statements, like spam = 10. What is the difference between an expression and a statement?

A5. The main difference is that expressions produce values, while statements perform actions or control the flow of a program. Assignment statements, like spam = 10, are a type of statement that assigns a value to a variable.



6. After running the following code, what does the variable bacon contain?
bacon = 22
bacon + 1

A6. 22 ( this result is not assigned back to the bacon variable )


7. What should the values of the following two terms be?
'spam' + 'spamspam'
'spam' * 3

A7. spamspamspam (both same)



8. Why is eggs a valid variable name while 100 is invalid?

A8. Variable cannot be started with a number but must start with letter or a underscore character.


9. What three functions can be used to get the integer, floating-point number, or string version of a value?

A9. int --> int()
    float --> float()
    string--> str()


10. Why does this expression cause an error? How can you fix it?
'I have eaten ' + 99 + ' burritos.'

A10.  as python can only concatenate string (not "int) to str.
